# Code Parser for LLM Responses

As part of Mercor projects, code reviewers receive a large body of text containing a conversation between a human and a LLM. This contains code and updates throughout the whole conversation, which the reviewers must read to stay up-to-date on the latest version to then finally run.

This code parser will be used for inputting the entire text body, and outputting each stage in a digestible format.
